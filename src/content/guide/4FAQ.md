## WiiLink
### Information about the service itself.

#### Why WiiLink?

   > WiiLink is the only service to bring back Japanese exclusive Wii channels after they were officially shut down.
        We’ve made Wii no Ma and the Digicam Print Channel functional once more.
        We’re hard at work on the Demae Channel, letting you order food directly from your Wii.
    With our service, you can experience all of these once more on your Nintendo Wii - possibly for the first time.

#### Why does WiiLink exist?

   > Without a replacement service for these Japanese and Streaming channels, they would be lost to time, never to be seen again. However, thanks to our work, future generations of players can experience these channels again!

#### Is using WiiLink legal?

   > Absolutely. We develop all of our channels without copyrighted code and material, and rely solely on what is provided within the channel and public knowledge. All code is written from the ground up. You will have no legal trouble from using our service.

#### Will the Demae Channel order real food?

   > Yes! Some current information:
        Support has been developed for Domino’s in USA and Canada.
        There are plans to expand more services over to Demae for other countries.

#### How do I update a WiiLink channel?

   > Updating WiiLink channels is the exact same as installing! Simply run the WiiLink or Striim patcher once more, and install the created WADs.

#### I’m recieving error -1022 when trying to install WiiLink WADs on a WAD manager
