## FAQ
### Kirby TV Channel freezes on the Now Showing page, what do I do?
> If you find that the Kirby TV Channel is freezing when you get to the "Now Showing" screen, that's because all of the Kirby: Right Back At Ya' episodes have finished airing!

> We are working on a rerun for the channel, so stay tuned for when we make an announcement about that in our Discord server or on Twitter.
