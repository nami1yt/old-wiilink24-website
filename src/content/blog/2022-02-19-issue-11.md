Hey there! It is me back with another news article for you peeps! There has been alot of stuff going on behind the scenes of WiiLink so get ready!

#### Striim Network has merged with WiiLink

On the 15th of February 2022, the Striim Network service merged with WiiLink! This is great for both services for 2 great reasons. It means WiiLink users will get media applications on their Wii such as Kirby TV Channel and YouTube! Alongside that, it means the development team for Striim will be bigger! This means that development can happen faster :D

#### New Wii Room content

Recently, we have been searching for as much old content that was originally on Wii Room as possible. After researching for a bit, we discovered that there were 3 shows that were put onto DVDs after the cessation of service: "The Illustrated Book of the Universe" (*森羅万象地球図鑑*), "The Fascinating Repairman" and "Tondemo! Science" (*トンデモ！さいえんす*).

After a while, our friend Snap found an auction link to [The Illustrated Book of the Universe](https://buyee.jp/item/yahoo/auction/x1028136781) on Buyee, and they bought it! This currently is on the Wii Room service :D

Quite recently, [Tondemo! Science](https://buyee.jp/mercari/item/m31421225568) was also found! The owner of WiiLink (Sketch) had bought it and is working on putting it on Wii Room. In celebration of this, we had a Mii contest of Dr Tondemo in our [Discord server]({{ site.discord }}), in which Jaff80 won! Here is the Mii they created:

The Mii will be put up as a guest sometime soon and so will the show! Keep an eye out on the news page to see when.

#### WiiConnect24 channels are making their way to WiiLink

You heard that right, WiiConnect24 channels are being developed! We all feel like this is a great move for the service to make it easier for our users. Alongside this, you may have noticed the 5 new items in the services section. Nintendo Channel, Everybody Votes Channel and Mii Contest channel; those are the WiiConnect24 channels. YouTube and Kirby TV Channel; the Striim Network channels. Sketch has been working hard, creating the servers for Everybody Votes Channel, and he is super close to completing it already in a few days, ready for testers hopefully by the weekend. Nintendo Channel also has alot of progress, so keep an eye out for news on that.

And thats all for now! I really hope you enjoyed this and are excited for the WiiConnect24 channels because I know I am :D Have fun, and enjoy your weekend!
