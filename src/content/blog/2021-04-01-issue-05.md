Yes, the Wii Fit Body Check Channel was unfortunately a rickroll. April Fools! However, we do have something good and legitimate to announce this lovely April 1st. After seeing how legitimately interested people were in the Wii Fit Body Check Channel and how excited people were for its release, we gained a real interest in bringing it back. As such, we are excited to announce that as of today, the Wii Fit Body Check Channel is officially in development!

We are all genuinely sorry for this and, as you can see, are now working on it. Thanks for reading and sorry for getting your hopes up.
