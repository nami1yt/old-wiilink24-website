Here's the latest on everything WiiLink24:

- The site has gotten a bit of a makeover! Rather than have one page for everything, there are now individual pages for the services. This way, we can have screenshots and more detailed info about each service.
- The Public Beta is OUT! Wii Room is now available to all in the form of a beta. This means that not everything is present as of now but we'll add more features in the future. To get it, check out the Guide!
- Thanks to everyone who was part of the launch event on the 5th! We had an awesome time in our Discord!

Thanks for reading, see you next time for another news report!
